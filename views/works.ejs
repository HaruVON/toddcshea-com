					<b>Challenge</b>: Rebrand three consolidated companies 
					to create one integrated brand that maintains 
					the credibility of the separate entities.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Corporate Strategy</b>: Distinguish the company as 
					a complete solutions provider with the only 
					integrated network of facilities to support the 
					entire brand lifecycle.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Marketing Strategy</b>:  Identify a unique, one-word 
					name separate from the previous companies that 
					positions the company as a visionary partner, 
					offering innovation in every aspect of its 
					business.<br>

					<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0.4rem;"></span>

					Focus of market positioning revolved around 
					integration, manufacturing solutions, brand 
					lifecycle support, innovation, and faster speed 
					to market.<br>

					<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0.4rem;"></span>
										
					Visuals were bold and unique yet designed to 
					communicate the behind-the-scenes position of 
					this strategic solutions partner.
				</p>

				<p>
					<b>Product Strategy</b>: Innovate with smaller, 
					emerging brands and allow this innovation to 
					drive direction and solutions for larger 
					brands.

					<b>Challenge</b>: Accelerate a stagnant contract 
					manufacturing business, reduce inventory levels, 
					and improve EBITDA to position for sale.<br><br>
	
					<b>Strategy</b>: Create added value for brand 
					partners with proactive innovation and a flexible 
					formula library, reducing development time and 
					increasing speed to market. Couple this approach 
					with an improved service model to reduce the 
					challenges associated with outside product 
					development and manufacturing.<br><br>
	
					<b>Marketing Strategy</b>: Use bold, iconic brand imagery 
					inspired by the companyâ€™s Los Angeles heritage that 
					speaks to the final decision makers in marketing and 
					product development with familiar B2C elements that 
					differentiate the company from other contract manufacturers.<br><br>

					<b>Product Strategy</b>: Introduce proactive innovations to 
					branded customers to assist them in product 
					differentiation and white space identification. Offer 
					a formula library organized to simplify the product 
					development process while allowing ample room for 
					each formula to be a custom product.<br><br>

					<b>Sales Strategy</b>: Approach the sale on every level of 
					customer interaction, delivering the brand promise 
					at each customer touchpoint, while focusing on emerging 
					brands as the target customer.
